NAME
    Class::DBI::Untaint - Class::DBI constraints using CGI::Untaint

SYNOPSIS
      use base 'Class::DBI';
      use Class::DBI::Untaint;

      ___PACKAGE__->columns(All => qw/id value entered/);
      ___PACKAGE__->constrain_column(value => Untaint => "integer");
      ___PACKAGE__->constrain_column(entered => Untaint => "date");

DESCRIPTION
    Using this module will plug-in a new constraint type to Class::DBI that
    uses CGI::Untaint.

    Any column can then be said to require untainting of a given type - i.e.
    that any value which you attempted to set that column to (include at
    create() time) must pass an untaint as_type() check.

    In the examples above, the 'value' column must pass the check in
    CGI::Untaint::integer, and similarly 'entered' must untaint as a date.

SEE ALSO
    Class::DBI, CGI::Untaint.
